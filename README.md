# MusicBrainz Track Parsers #

This repository is a collection of perl scripts that can automatically pull in release information from various sources, format it and prepare it as much as possible for inserting into MusicBrainz. Each folder has it's own README file to document how the enclosed script(s) work. Give the relevant directory a click.
